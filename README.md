# ChatGPT_Swift

Welcome to the ChatGPT_Swift repository! This repository contains a Swift implementation of the OpenAI GPT-3 language model for generating natural language responses in a chatbot application. The implementation uses the OpenAISwift library to interface with the OpenAI API.

To use this implementation, you will need an OpenAI API key. You can sign up for an OpenAI account and generate an API key on the OpenAI website.

You will also need Xcode 13 or later and the Swift Package Manager (SPM) installed on your system.
